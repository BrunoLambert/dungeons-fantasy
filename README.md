# Dungeon Fantasy

This is my personal repository for Macros that I use on my campaign of _Dungeons and Dragons_ on [FondryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) using a world of Final Fantasy XIV, [based on a homebrew content provied by SilentSoren](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LsDqsNbupzeLhkTIcPv).

NOTE: You may find some texts in Portuguese on macros. Use translator or asked for English version for the text.

## Dependencies

You must install some dependencies (add-ons) for macros to work properly.

Some of the dependencies used: 
- [Sequencer](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/sequencer)
- [Warpgate](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/warpgate)
- [Midi-QoL](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/midi-qol)
- [DFreds Convenient Effects](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dfreds-convenient-effects)
- [JB2A](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/JB2A_DnD5e)

Note that some paths for the files are relative to my campaign's folders. Also I won't provide the files I use in my campaign for legal reasons.

## Updates

The campaign is still going, so many updates to go.
